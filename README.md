## About Me

  My name is Nicc Yoder and I'm not entirely sure what to say here so im just typing some words to test this thing out.
In order to complete my lab assignment a needed to have the readme-edits shown, which I accidentally deleted, so here
are some more edits.

### Open Pull Request

  I'm leaving an open pull request for the lab just incase. I'm not sure if a pull request will remain shown once it is 
 accepted.
